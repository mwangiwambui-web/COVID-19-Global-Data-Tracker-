# üåç Global COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

This project presents a data analysis and reporting notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations to uncover insights into COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across countries and over time.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze time-based trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries and regions
- Create interactive and static visualizations
- Summarize and communicate insights in a presentable format

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run/View the Project

1. Clone this repository (git remote add origin https://github.com/mwangiwambui-web/COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker-.git) or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the project folder in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Jupyter extension.
3. Run each cell in the `COVID_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb` or `main.py` to:
   - Load and clean the data
   - Perform analysis
   - Generate charts and maps

**Required File**: Ensure `owid-covid-data.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook or script.

## üìä Key Insights

- Countries like the USA and India show the highest total cases over time.
- Vaccination rates vary significantly, with high-income countries achieving faster rollouts.
- A clear correlation exists between strict lockdown timelines and reduced daily new cases in some countries.
- Some developing countries show lower total cases, possibly due to underreporting or lower testing rates.

## üìå Reflections

This project provided hands-on experience with real-world data analysis using Python. Key learnings include:
- Cleaning large datasets with missing or inconsistent values
- Visual storytelling using line charts, bar plots, and choropleths
- Importance of accurate data interpretation and context
